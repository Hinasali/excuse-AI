### Project Description  
excuse-AI is your go-to AI-powered assistant for generating clever, quirky, or oddly convincing excuses—whether you're late for a meeting, missed a deadline, or just don't want to go out. Type your situation, and let the excuses roll in!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Coming up with creative excuses is *hard*, especially when you're binge-watching shows, napping, or pretending to be productive.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
An AI-powered excuse generator that saves brainpower for better things—like napping more. Just enter your scenario and get an excuse that's good enough to make you sound *almost* responsible.
